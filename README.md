# TicketShare

TicketShare is a web app that helps users easily share details about any event or travel booking with others.

## Features
- View all your bookings in one place
- See details for each booking
- Add new bookings
- (Planned) Share bookings with other people

## Project Structure
- **Utilities folder**: Contains reusable code (components) as needed.
- **Partials**: EJS partials for layout elements (e.g., navigation, header, footer). You can swap these out for different pages as needed.
- **Models**: Functions to retrieve data in bulk or by individual entry.
- **Routes**: Handles routing for main, bookings, and details pages.
- **Controllers**: (Planned) Would separate route logic into controllers for better organization.

## Notes
My original idea was to show the user the people they had shared their trip with by clicking a button and opening a new page. This page would also allow them to add a new person to share with. Due to lack of time, I decided to simply have the main page, bookings page, and details page.

I was going to separate the routes and their controller functions into the Controllers folder, but I ran out of time working on CSS.

## Future Improvements
- Implement sharing functionality and user management
- Complete controller separation for cleaner code
- Enhance CSS and add more responsive design
